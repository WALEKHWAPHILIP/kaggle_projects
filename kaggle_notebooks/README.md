## Kaggle Notebooks
- [Data Cleaning and EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/walekhwatlphilip/notebook524401d43e): This notebook focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a synthetic dataset. It covers handling missing values, feature transformations, and basic data visualization.
- [Intro to Data Cleaning, EDA, and Machine Learning Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/walekhwatlphilip/intro-to-data-cleaning-eda-and-machine-learning): A dataset used in the notebook for practicing data cleaning and EDA.
## Project Structure
- `kaggle_notebooks/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks from Kaggle covering data science topics.
- `data/` - Contains datasets used in the projects (some may be linked to Kaggle datasets directly).
- `scripts/` - Any Python scripts created for data processing.
## Installation and Usage
To run the notebooks locally, make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:
